DEVOPS TRACK - STAGE 0 Task: Linux Server Setup & Nginx Configuration

Welcome to HNG Cool Keeds! The floodgates to the cloud are now widely open

Overview

You will provision a Linux server, install and configure Nginx to serve two different locations, and secure it with a valid SSL certificate. No Docker, no Compose, no automation tools just a bare Linux server and your hands.

What You Must Do

1. Server Setup

Provision a Linux server (any cloud provider) and do the following:
Create a non-root user called hngdevops with sudo privileges  
Configure passwordless sudo for hngdevops for /usr/sbin/sshd and /usr/sbin/ufw  
Disable root SSH login  
Disable password-based SSH authentication — key-based only  
Configure UFW to allow only ports 22, 80, and 443\. All other ports must be closed

2. Nginx Configuration

Install Nginx and configure it to serve the following:
GET / : serves a static HTML page that contains your HNG username visibly as text on the page  
GET /api : returns the following JSON response exactly:

json  
{  
  "message": "HNGI14 Stage 0",  
  "track": "DevOps",  
  "username": "your-hng-username"  
}
username must match your registered HNG username exactly.

3. SSL

Obtain a valid SSL certificate using Let’s Encrypt (Certbot) for your domain and configure Nginx to serve both endpoints over HTTPS. HTTP requests must redirect to HTTPS with a 301.

Tiny Technicalities
 /api must return Content-Type: application/json  Nginx’s add_header directive handles this  
 /api must return HTTP status 200  
 The username field in the JSON must match your HNG registered username exactly, wrong casing fails  
 HTTP to HTTPS redirect must be a 301, not a 302  
 The SSL certificate must be a valid Let’s Encrypt cert  self-signed certificates will fail the bot check  
 The static HTML page at / must contain your HNG username as visible text, hidden or commented-out text fails  
 Nginx must be the active web server    
 UFW must be active
 hngdevops must be able to run sshd -T and ufw status without a password prompt
 Sudoers example: hngdevops ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/sshd,/usr/sbin/ufw

You will receive a public SSH key to add to your servers for checking. at the #track-devops channel

Submission

To submit, go to the #track-devops channel and use /submit 
Submit the following:
 Your live domain (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com`)  
Your HNG username

Deadline: Thursday 16th of April 2026. No extensions.

May the forces be with you Cool Keeds!
